- Cortography (CORTical cartOGRAPHY) is a repository of utility tools and curated, collaborative collection of cortical and subcortical atlases for neuroimaging research.
- The atlas utilities are based on [Andreas Horn's](http://andreas-horn.de) detailed [collection of atlas parcellations](http://www.lead-dbs.org/helpsupport/knowledge-base/atlasesresources/cortical-atlas-parcellations-mni-space).
- If you find any inaccurate information, or know of an atlas not currently in this list, feel free to fork this repository, include the missing atlas, and submit a Pull Request. Happy mapping.
